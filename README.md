# Wordle

This is a very simple program I wrote to determine what the best first guess would be. Higher ranking words were determined by how many yellow letters they would get. I don't think these are actually the best guesses, as what you quickly realize is that the highest ranking words for this program are simply the ones with the most vowels.
